## Test Comments
As laid out by Andy, I didn't try to complete the entire page, and focused on how I'd handle Redux, the data from it to create the page elements, and responsive SCSS. I tried to remain under the given time, and realised I'd run out while playing with the header.

To this extent, I've handled the Testimonials segment, header and footer. With the exception of how the elements are laid out on screen and their interactibility, I'd handle Case Studies and Projects similarly to Testimonials. By looping through the gathered data and mapping it to a child React component.

I've tried using Vite to host the webpage, since I've not used it before. I found it to be a bit of a faff compared to my experiences with Node.js for hosting webpages.

I also primarily used Typescript as outlined in the specification.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
